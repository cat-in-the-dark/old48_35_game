Rumors are that there is a creepy creature crawling at nights in this forest: half a man, half a wolf. Nearby villiagers find enourmously large traces of unknown beast time to time. Many hunters went into the forest, trying to track and kill the beast, but nobody came back alive. 

Facts are that there is no calm place for peaceful werewolf in this formerly calm and quite forest. Loud peasants shouting for no reason, curious hunters tracking your traces in search of glory - all this makes you tired, angry and hungry. 

So, okay, this is a **network** game, you can play as a werewolf or as a hunter. Game assumes that you have friend to play with **over Internet**.
